**BeatChain** is a decentralized and collaborative music protocol built on Farcaster and the Base blockchain. It transforms music creation into a social, sequential, and ownable experience. Users collaboratively build 12-second musical tracks ("Beats") by adding 4-second layers. Each contribution is recorded on-chain, and the final, completed Beat can be minted as a permanent, co-authored NFT.

Our vision is to create a fully on-chain creative protocol where digital music is collaboratively built, verifiably owned, and seamlessly shared.

## Core User Flow

1.  **Initiation (User A):** A user clicks a "Start a new Beat!" Frame. They are directed to the BeatChain Mini App. They create their 4-second segment in the sequencer. Upon submission, the app uploads the audio segment to **Pinata (IPFS)**, gets the content identifier (CID), and prompts the user to sign a transaction to the **BeatChain smart contract**. This transaction creates the new Beat on-chain, storing the IPFS CID of the first segment. The user pays a gas fee. The Frame updates to show a "Continue the Beat!" button.
2.  **Collaboration (User B):** Clicks "Continue the Beat!". In the app, they create the next 4-second segment. Upon submission, the audio is uploaded to Pinata, and User B is prompted to sign a transaction that calls the `addSegment` function on the smart contract, passing the new IPFS CID. They pay a gas fee.
3.  **Completion (User C):** Repeats the process for the final segment. When their transaction is confirmed, the smart contract automatically marks the Beat as **"Completed"** and ready for minting.
4.  **Frame Update:** The Farcaster Frame now updates its button to say **"Mint this Beat!"**.
5.  **Minting (Any User):** A user clicks the "Mint this Beat!" button and is taken to the completed track page. They click a "Mint NFT" button, sign a final transaction, and pay a gas fee. The smart contract mints the Beat NFT to their wallet. The NFT's metadata points to the final audio file and lists the three contributors.
